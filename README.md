ðŸ“Š Population Distribution by Age Group â€“ Data Visualization Task
This project visualizes global population distribution across various age groups using a real-world dataset. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, bar charts and histograms were created to highlight demographic patterns for different countries. The task demonstrates data cleaning, age group analysis, and customized plotting for clearer insights. It was completed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology.
